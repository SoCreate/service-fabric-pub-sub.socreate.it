<h1>Upgrading To Version 8</h1>
<section>
  <p>Significant changes were made in v8.0.0, including breaking changes to interfaces and tools.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>BrokerActor and RelayBrokerActor were removed. Actors don't make a good Broker, use BrokerService instead.</li>
    <li>ServiceFabric.PubSubActors.Interfaces library was removed. Only the main library is required now.</li>
    <li>Obsolete extension methods were removed.</li>
    <li>Helper classes were removed and replaced with <code>BrokerClient</code>.</li>
    <li>V2 is the only supported Service Fabric Remoting version.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Tips</h4>
  <p>Here are some tips to help you through the upgrade process:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Upgrade Remoting To V2</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>v8.0 only supports remoting V2. If you are using .NET Standard, you should already be using V2 and you can skip this step.</li>
        <li>
            Refer to documentation here:
            <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-services-communication-remoting#upgrade-from-remoting-v1-to-remoting-v2">Upgrade From Remoting V1 to Remoting V2</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Upgrade the Broker first. Override <code>BrokerService.CreateServiceReplicaListeners()</code> to use the extension method
          mentioned in the above link so you can use the assembly attribute to set up listening on V1 and V2.</li>
        <li>
          Upgrade Publisher and Subscriber services. Use the <code>useRemotingV2</code> option when creating the BrokerServiceLocator
          that is used by Helper classes.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Upgrade the Broker</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Remove the ServiceFabric.PubSubActors.Interfaces library and upgrade the ServiceFabric.PubSubActors library to 8.0.</li>
        <li>
          Publish message and Receive message are backwards compatible, so update BrokerService first and publishers and subscribers
          should continue to function.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Upgrade Subscribers</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Register/Unregister has been replaced by Subscribe/Unsubscribe, so you won't be able to subscribe/unsubscribe until you
          update subscriber services.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the ServiceFabric.PubSubActors.Interfaces library and upgrade the ServiceFabric.PubSubActors library to 8.0.</li>
        <li>
            Extension methods and helper classes have been removed. If you are using any of them in your Subscriber services, they
            will need to be refactored to use the BrokerClient or one of the Subscriber base classes (see documentation above).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Upgrade Publishers</strong>
      <em>(Optional, publishing is backwards compatible)</em>
      <ul>
        <li>Remove the ServiceFabric.PubSubActors.Interfaces library and upgrade the ServiceFabric.PubSubActors library to 8.0.</li>
        <li>Extension method and helper classes have been removed. Use BrokerClient.PublishMessageAsync() instead.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
