<h1>Subscribing To Messages</h1>
<section markdown>
  You can subscribe to messages using 
  <a
    routerLink="/docs/how-to/subscribe-to-messages" 
    fragment="using-services-with-base-class">Services with our base class</a>, using
  <a 
    routerLink="/docs/how-to/subscribe-to-messages"
    fragment="using-services-without-base-class">Services without our base class</a>, or using
  <a
    routerLink="/docs/how-to/subscribe-to-messages"
    fragment="using-actors">Actors</a>.

  All projects containing subscribing Services or Actors must

  Install the Nuget package:
  ```
  dotnet add package ServiceFabric.PubSubActors --version 8.0.0
  ```

  Add a project reference to the shared data contracts library.

  #### Using Services With our Base Class

  In this example, the Service called 'SubscribingStatelessService' subscribes to messages of Type 'PublishedMessageOne' and 'PublishedMessageTwo'.

  Add a Reliable Stateless Service project called 'SubscribingStatelessService'.

  Now open the file SubscribingStatelessService.cs in the project 'SubscribingStatelessService' and replace the 
  SubscribingStatelessService class with this code:
</section>
<div markdown path="content/docs/how-to/subscribing-services-with-base-class.md"></div>
<section markdown>
  The SubscriberStatelessServiceBase class automatically handles subscribing to the message types that were
  registered using the `Subscribe` attribute when the service is 'opened'.

  To subscribe from a Stateful Service, extend `SubscriberStatefulServiceBase` instead of `SubscribingStatelessServiceBase`.

  #### Using Services Without the Base Class

  If you don't want to inherit from one of our base classes, you can set up your service like this:
</section>
<div markdown path="content/docs/how-to/subscribing-services-without-base-class.md"></div>
<section markdown>
  #### Using Services With The Bootstrapper

  If you don't want to inherit from one of our base classes and still want to use the `Subscribe` attribute to automatically
  subscribe and set up message handlers, you can use the `StatefulSubscriberServiceBootstrapper` and
  `StatelessSubscriberServiceBootstrapper` as a wrapper around the service factory delegate in Program.cs.

  The code in `Program` will look like this:
</section>
<div markdown path="content/docs/how-to/subscribing-services-with-bootstrapper-program.md"></div>
<section markdown>
  The service looks like this:
</section>
<div markdown path="content/docs/how-to/subscribing-services-with-bootstrapper-service.md"></div>
<section markdown>
  For stateful services, use the `StatefulSubscriberServiceBootstrapper`.

  #### Using Actors
  In this example, the Actor called 'SubscribingActor' subscribes to messages of Type 'PublishedMessageOne'.

  Add a Reliable Stateless Actor project called 'SubscribingActor'.

  Open the file 'SubscribingActor.cs' and replace the contents with the code below.
</section>
<div markdown path="content/docs/how-to/subscribing-actors.md"></div>
