<h1>Broker Configuration</h1>
<section markdown>
  The BrokerService provides the following properties that can be set by the derived class to configure the behavior of the BrokerService.

  * ServiceEventSourceMessageCallback : When Set, this callback will be used to trace Service messages to.
  * ListenerName : The name that the `ServiceReplicaListener` instance will get.
  * DueTime : The interval to wait before starting to publish messages. (Default: 5s after Activation)
  * Period : The interval to wait between batches of publishing messages. (Default: 1s)
  * ThrottleFactor : The amount to throttle queue processing when deliveries are failing.  Slow down queue processing by a factor of X. (Default 10)
  * MaxProcessingPeriod : The maximum period to process messages before allowing enqueuing. (Default 3s)
  * MaxDequeuesInOneIteration : The maximum number of messages to de-queue in one iteration of process queue. (Default 100)

  #### Broker Events
  The following events can be subscribed to by the user to implement additional logging or other functionality.

  * **Subscribed**: Fired when a Service or Actor subscribes to a message type.
  * **Unsubscribed**: Fired when a Service or Actor unsubscribes to a message type.
  * **MessagePublished**: Fired when a Service or Actor publishes a message, even if there are no subscribers, once per message.
  * **MessageQueuedToSubscriber**: Fired when a published message is enqueued to a subscriber queue, once per subscriber.  (This was called "MessageReceived" in v9)
  * **MessageDelivered**: Fired when a message is successfully delivered to a subscriber.
  * **MessageDeliveryFailed**: Fired when a message fails to be delivered to a subscriber.

  To subscribe to events, override the SetUpEvents() method.

  #### Custom Service Fabric Proxy Factories
  By default, Service Fabric PubSub uses the default remoting communication messages which are xml serialized.
  Some projects use custom remoting serialization (such as custom json serializers).
  The `IProxyFactories` interface handles the creation of Proxy instances.
  To customize this, you can implement your own version of `IProxyFactories` and pass it to the `BrokerService` and the
  `BrokerClient` (via the `BrokerServiceLocator`).
