<h1>Broker Stats</h1>
<section markdown>
  The BrokerClient offers a way to get some basic information about what is going on in the BrokerService. Calling
  `BrokerClient.GetBrokerStats()` provides a Dictionary with one item for each queue (subscription) that the Broker is managing.
  The key is the name of the queue and the value is a list of QueueStat objects. Each QueueStat object is a snapshot of
  the state of the queue at the time the request was made. The QueueStat object includes the name of the service, the total
  number of messages received, the total number of messages delivered, and time the snapshot was taken. The totals are
  cumulative from the moment the queue was created.

  A new snapshot is added each time `BrokerClient.GetBrokerStats()` is called, so the user has control over the polling frequency.
  The BrokerClient keeps a fixed number of snapshots per queue defined by BrokerClient.QueueStatCapacity, which defaults
  to 100. When the 101st snapshot is created, the oldest one will be trimmed from the list.

  What information can you get:

  * A list of all queues (subscriptions) and the subscriber services they serve.
  * The total number of messages received and delivered, as well as the total number of delivery failures for each queue.
  * If the difference between the total received and the total delivered is growing, the queue is taking in messages faster than they can be delivered (or the subscriber is down).
  * With a little extra processing, the number of messages received and delivered in a given time period can be calculated. A UI could graph this data to show the load on each queue over time.

  Armed with a list of queueNames, you can use `BrokerClient.UnsubscribeByQueueNameAsync()` to unsubscribe on behalf of another service.
