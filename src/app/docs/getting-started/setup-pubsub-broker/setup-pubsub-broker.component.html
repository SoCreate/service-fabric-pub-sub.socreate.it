<h1>Set Up The Pub/Sub Broker</h1>
<section markdown>
  Add a new Stateful Reliable Service project. We'll call it 'PubSubBroker'.

  Install the Nuget package:

  ```
  dotnet add package SoCreate.ServiceFabric.PubSub
  ```

  Replace the code of PubSubBroker.cs with the following code:
</section>
<div markdown path="content/docs/getting-started/setup-pubsub-broker.md"></div>
<section markdown>
  *The BrokerService delivers messages in the order they are received using `IReliableQueue`.  If you need higher throughput
  and don't need messages in order, you can extend `BrokerServiceUnordered` which uses `IReliableConcurrentQueue`*
</section>
