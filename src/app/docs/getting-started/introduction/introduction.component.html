<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
  Service Fabric allows you to deploy many apps (microservices) in a single "Cluster".  Service Fabric provides a mechanism
  for services to communicate with each other called "Service Remoting".  This package implements the Publish/Subscribe
  pattern to implement reliable asynchronous messaging between services using Service Remoting V2.

  ##### The Broker
  At the center of the Pub/Sub pattern is a Broker.  Service Fabric Pub/Sub uses a Stateful Reliable Service as a Broker.

  ##### Publishers
  Publishers publish a message to the Broker indicating that an event has occurred.  They have no knowledge of what happens
  to the message after delivering it to the Broker.  Publishers never communicate directly to Subscribers.  Publishers can
  be any Reliable Service or Actor in the Cluster.

  ##### Subscribers
  Subscribers subscribe to a message type through the Broker.  The Broker delivers messages received by Publishers to Subcribers
  who subscribe to that message type.  Subscribers can be any Reliable Service or Actor in the Cluster.  Subscribers can
  subscribe to multiple message types and multiple Subscribers can subscribe to the same message type.

  ##### Data Contracts
  Messages are simple, serializable POCO objects.  Publishers and Subscribers never communicate directly, but they do need a shared knowledge
  of these message object types.  You will need to define these types in a library that can be shared across all Publishers
  and Subscribers.
