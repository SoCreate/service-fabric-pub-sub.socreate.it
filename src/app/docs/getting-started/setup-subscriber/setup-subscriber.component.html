<h1>Set Up a Subscriber Service</h1>
<section markdown>
  *In this example we are using the base class to set up a stateless service subscriber.  For more ways to set up a subscriber, see [Subscribe To Messages](/docs/how-to/subscribe-to-messages).*

  Add a Reliable Stateless Service project called 'SubscribingStatelessService'.

  Install the Nuget package:
  ```
  dotnet add package ServiceFabric.PubSubActors --version 8.0.0
  ```

  Add a project reference to the shared data contracts library 'DataContracts'.

  Replace the `SubscribingStatelessService` with the following code:
</section>
<div markdown path="content/docs/how-to/subscribing-services-with-base-class.md"></div>
<section markdown>
  The SubscriberStatelessServiceBase class automatically handles subscribing to the message types that were
  registered using the `Subscribe` attribute when the service is 'opened'.
