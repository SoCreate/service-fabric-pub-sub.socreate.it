<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<section markdown>
  First, you'll need to install the Nuget package:
  
  ```
  dotnet add package SoCreate.ServiceFabric.PubSub
  ```

  Using this package you can reliably send messages from Publishers (Actors/Services) to many Subscribers (Actors/Services).
  This is done using an intermediate, which is the BrokerService. Add this package to all Reliable Actor & Service projects
  that participate in the pub/sub messaging.
